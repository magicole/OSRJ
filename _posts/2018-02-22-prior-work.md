Robotic arms and motor control systems are nothing new. Instead of reinventing the wheel, I'm going to look at prior work done by others and see what I can incorporate into the OSRJ project. Below are some other projects that include components and ideas that I think will be useful. Projects are in no particular order.

- [Mechaduino](https://hackaday.io/project/11224-mechaduino)
    - Integrated stepper motor servo drive unit with magnetic encoder
    - Fits on back of stepper motor
    - Selling for $49 for just the PCB
    - Uses SAMD21 MCU
    - i2c or serial control
- [3D Printable Robot Arm - Large](https://hackaday.io/project/3800-3d-printable-robot-arm)
    - Larger than most robot arm projects
    - Uses stepper motors
    - Fully 3D printed design
    - Attempted a harmonic drive but it didn't work
    - On the slow side
- [ODrive](https://hackaday.io/project/11583-odrive-high-performance-motor-control)
    - Open source brushless motor driver
    - Brushless motors provide more power and speed
    - Encoder feedback and regenerative braking
    - Multiple control protocols
- [Thor Open Source Robotic Arm](https://hackaday.io/project/12989-thor)
    - Fully 3D printed structure
    - Uses stepper motors
    - 62.5 cm long and can lift 750 grams
    - Designed with education in mind
    - ~$430 build cost
    - Not bad speed from demo video
- [MeArm](https://hackaday.io/project/181-mearm-your-robot)
    - Low cost (~$35) RC servo driven arm
    - I have one and have created a control [shield for it](https://github.com/magicole/Robot_Arm_Controller)
    - Small range and lifting capacity
    - Made from laser cut acrylic
