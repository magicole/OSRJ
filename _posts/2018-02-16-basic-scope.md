This project will focus on building robotic joints for use in a robot arm. Joints are being focused on because the scope of builing a "robot arm" would be too large. The ultimate goal is to integrate multiple joint units into a robot arm for the final demonstration, but the arm is not the main focus. 

The basic features of the joint are listed below in no particular order. 

* Fully integrated unit with gearbox, motor, motor driver, microcontroller, and housing
* Joints will target a <= $100 cost per joint. This greatly depends on what motors/gearboxes are used
* Absolute position sensing for feedback control
* Daisy-chainable. Units should only have two plugs on them, input and output
